## Our Griffon!

Our Griffon is amazing,
but our cat is more so;
he's a charming hairdresser,
of rare skill,
my word!

It does not tear more
forty hairs
to the people he combs:
it is not much!

Our Groffon has mustaches
like an old soldier,
well, our cat puts them
cosmetics with his tongue,
after which they have spikes
like lightning rods!
So all the passers-by say,
when our Griffon walks:
 - "This dog is beautifully dressed,
it is undoubtedly a dog of the very large world? "


## The griffin portrait

Our Griffon was painted
by a great artist member of the Institute.
You will see this portrait at the Salon,
This year. The artist took
oil or butter colors,
I don't know anymore, to do
this remarkable work.


## Blind Azor.
"Have pity on a poor blind man?"
 - "Certainly, my old Azor;
here's two cents for you, "
said the rich Caesar in passing.

But, old Azor, added Caesar,
you should hire a man
to drive you and to
to put your bowl in your mouth?


## Russian mountains

The descent is dizzying!
But, too bad, it's a lot of fun.
The wind rolls up our ears,
because we are going at a breakneck pace!
Hold on, comrades!
Forward! forward! Yes, but there you go
that poor Tom who stays behind!


## At the tennis court
It was a famous game;
it lasted four and a quarter hours,
The opponents wore big names:
One was Baron des Hautes-Gouttières,
the other, the Vicomte de Tape-à-l'Œil.
They wet four shirts.

The whole club attended the fight.
The emotion was very keen.
The players were throwing the balls at each other
in the nose, to break the teeth!
The gallery applauded the blows.
M. de Tape-àl'Œil was the victor.

## An interesting move.

## Naive homage.

One day three little dogs,
three little innocents,
saw Our Griffon
that made you take the air
to his beautiful mustaches,
They came humbly
stand in front of him,
and said ... wow! Wow ! Wow ! with admiration

Our Griffon said to them,
all filled with indulgence
for these poor little ones;
- Look at me, my neighbors!

- "It is not forbidden
and I allow you.
You might like
know how i do
for such amazing mustaches? "

"Well, I grease them
with tiger blood
mixed with lion's blood!
It's not more difficult
only that, my little friends .... "

Small trembling dogs
began to ... cry, saying: Wow! Wow ! Wow !

##

Rrrr ... I'm not afraid of you!
Rrrr ... you are very naughty!
If I weren't a dog
higher education,
I'll bite your nose, me!
Rrrr ... you dare not answer me,
and you are doing very well,
because I could lose patience!
